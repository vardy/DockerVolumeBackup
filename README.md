# DockerVolumeBackup

Todo:    
 - Add system for how long to keep old backups
 - Add options for verbosity (file upload progress in stdout) (logging levels)
 - Check all S3 actions for success (returns true)
 - Document setup process
 - Upload image to DockerHub
 - Is it safe to terminate at any point in the process? (use atexit?)
